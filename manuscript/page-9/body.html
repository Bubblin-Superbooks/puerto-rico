<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In those days I fell in love with a Puerto Rican girl who convinced me to become a terrorist. I joined the Latin American Defense Organization and drove to meetings in a green van. No one gave their real names but <em>nommes de guerre</em>. Black and red flags on the walls. We sang the <em>Internationale</em>. Everyone gave long speeches. The ones who couldn't speak Spanish stumbled through, trying. Puerto Rican independence was a given. It was the only real solution to their problems.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line">The example was set by the Irish Republican Army. Volunteers. Taxes raised from small bar and business owners in cities where there was a large Puerto Rican population. The order of battle divided into cells. The less you knew the better off the organization would be if you were captured. Name, rank and serial number. You could give no other information because you had no other information to give. Don't write anything</p></div> </div>
