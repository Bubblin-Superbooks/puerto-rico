#Puerto Rico
	In those days I fell in love with a Puerto Rican girl who convinced me to become a terrorist. I joined the Latin American Defense Organization and drove to meetings in a green van. No one gave their real names but *nommes de guerre*. Black and red flags on the walls. We sang the *Internationale*. Everyone gave long speeches. The ones who couldn't speak Spanish stumbled through, trying. Puerto Rican independence was a given. It was the only real solution to their problems. 
	
	The example was set by the Irish Republican Army. Volunteers. Taxes raised from small bar and business owners in cities where there was a large Puerto Rican population. The order of battle divided into cells. The less you knew the better off the organization would be if you were captured. Name, rank and serial number. You could give no other information because you had no other information to give. Don't write anything down. Keep everything in your head.
	
	All through it all, I loved her.  
	
	A container full of arms made in Czechoslovakia would be smuggled in from Cuba. Several tons worth. The shipment would be split up; there would be different landing sites. If one shipment was seized the others might still get through. 
	
	Targets were selected for their value as symbols. Killing had to be accidental. The courthouse where only the occupier's language was spoken. The Federal Reserve bank. The offices of the Territory's representative to Congress. The Social Security office that kept Puerto Ricans dependent. 
	
	All through it all, she loved me. 
	
	Off the island the military actions had to be more spectacular. Fermilab. There was plutonium there. If any of it escaped there would be mass panic. The English knew that Irish violence and the threat of Irish violence were the path to the negotiating table. 
	
	The Americans would tire of Puerto Rican violence soon enough. More autonomy and self-determination would come after that. Independence would naturally follow. 
	
	I wasn't even Puerto Rican. It wasn't my battle. I would be their Che Guevara.  I didn't pick the first target, though. The order came down. I was a soldier in a secret army where disobedient soldiers were shot. I had to obey. 
	
	I helped load the dynamite into a green van. I thought of the first time we slept together. I knew that she would love me all the more because I had done this. 
	
	I went back into the house. The phone rang. The others, outside, couldn't hear. 
	
	–What do you think you're doing?
	
	I recognized the voice immediately. 
	
	–Stop. Leave immediately. I let this little game go on for too long. 
	
	–You can't just come back into my life this way. 
	
	–I can. I have. Get out now. 
	
	–I can't, everything is set up. 
	
	–You are a fool. Nothing is set up. I am saving you. That should be obvious. Go now.
	
	Nothing was obvious. I went back outside and told the others that my sister had called, my mother had been taken to the hospital, I had to go. They were disappointed, but they understood. 
	
	I walked down the street towards the bus stop. 
	
	The next morning the FBI boasted of the arrest. She was arrested too. They all believed that I was an FBI plant. I was no Che Guevara. Worse, like all would-be revolutionaries, some lost their nerve. They said that there was another man who was to accompany them, a gringo. He's not even Puerto Rican. He must have called it in. You can find him easily. In their cells they despaired. 
	
	I called nothing in. I never told anyone. I lost all my friends. No one would have anything to do with me. They never bothered to look for me. My Puerto Rican girlfriend never spoke to me again. 
	
	The prosecutors called them terrorists. The group said they were freedom fighters and compared themselves to the IRA, to M-26, to the FSLN. The judge kept asking them to repeat the acronyms. He was not impressed. Not all of them got long sentences. 
	
	She called to cheer me up. The other one. The one who had destroyed my revolutionary career.

	–You should be happy. You're not in jail. 
	
	–I'll never see her again. 
	
	–You shouldn't have seen her in the first place. Forget her. You have me. A game of chess?
	
	No no no. I left. Even though no one was looking for me after an event like that someone might get bored and decide to run down leads. A photograph might have been taken at one of the meetings. There I was. What was I doing there? They might have fingerprints off the pallet I helped load into the van. Then it would be just the question of a match, ten points of comparison and I would be called upon to explain my actions. They would paint me as the mastermind. The worst one. The one who doesn't even care about Puerto Rico. He got us to do it, he got us to do it for the fun of it. He tricked us. He deceived us. We are not innocent but we deceived ourselves. 
	
	It would not have gone well.
	
	I had to get away from her. Why did she keep following me? What did she want from me? All I wanted was for her to leave me alone. She would beat me at chess anyway, there was no point in playing with her. 
	
	–I used to think you knew what you were doing," she said, but now I am pretty sure you have no idea.

	You could say that about a lot of people. She didn't care about other people. I don't know why she cared about me so much. Perhaps a priest would help. 
	
	But I knew no one would help. No one would believe me.
